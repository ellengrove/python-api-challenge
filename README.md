<br>
Utilized Python package citypy to generate a random list of 500+ cities across the world based on latitude and longitude. Using the OpenWeatherMap API, pulled local weather data for all available cities including maximum temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed and stored data in a Pandas dataframe. Plotted various weather metrics against the latitude of each city and performed regression analysis to identify any trends or relationships between latitude and different features of the weather or climate.

The jupyter notebook titled VacationPy utilizes the dataset generated previously to identify promising vacation destinations based on the weather recorded for each city at the time of collection. Using the Google Maps Places API, hotel information is collected for the top vacation destinations and is plotted on heat maps utilizing the Python gmaps package.
